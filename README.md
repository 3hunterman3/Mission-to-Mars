# Mission-to-Mars

A README.md that describes the purpose of the repository. Although there is no graded written analysis for this challenge, it is encouraged and good practice to add a brief description of your project.

### Purpose

- The purpose of this project was to be able to scrape data using python and after grabbing the images or data we needed we displayed it on our very own website. The website was created with JavaScript and HTML language. This project allowed me to create my own website and allowed me to utilize JavaScript to format a website and connect the written code into my HTML code to structure my website with various information.

### Picture of website

- The following is the picture of my website that scraped data.
